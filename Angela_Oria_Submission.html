        <h3>👩🏻‍🔧 The problem I encountered</h3>
        <p>
          An an <strong>undergraduate engineer</strong> at the Waterloo Metro
          Station project, being my first <i>ever</i> work experience. I was
          tasked to
          <strong> administer, manage and deliver the signage package</strong>
          for the whole station. At the design stage, multiple architectural
          drawings, plans and artwork had not yet been finalised in terms of
          locations, dimensions, finishes and substantially, the compliance
          issues had not yet been addressed according to Australian Standards,
          BCA codes and FrNSW Requirements.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="recovery">
        <h3>🧗🏻‍♀️ How I was able to move forward</h3>
        <p>
          Due to this initial exposure of the industry and liaising with
          multiple consultants whom I had never met. It was definite that
          <strong>taking initiative was my only play</strong>. First, I asked
          the services team who had dealt with these consultants for their
          contacts. After listing the contacts, I had
          <strong>checked each individual reports</strong> e.g. BCA for
          Waterloo, Fire Engineering Report and Acoustic Report and filtered any
          requirements for signage. Next, I collated all signage that needed to
          be addressed, as well as, found additional signage that had been
          missed in the drawings and
          <strong>put these into an excel sheet</strong> addressing their ID
          codes, art, dimension, quantity, compliance requirement and comments
          from the architects where certain signage were pending confirmation.
          Afterwards,
          <strong>I organised a time with individual consultants</strong> to
          address what was on the sheet and filtered their relevant ones so I
          could track the progress and comments accurately by the date on one
          document. Lastly, <strong>I collected all the data</strong>, confirmed
          the changes and delivered the solutions to the architects using Notion
          on a database table via a teams meeting I had also arranged.

        <h3>🤯 The lesson I learnt</h3>
        <p>
          The outcome to this design review process was long but rewarding. I
          was able to adjust using a
          <strong>data-driven approach and expand my negotiating skills</strong>
          by reaching out to consultants and understanding their perspectives.
          The ability to track delays with certain items and using reason to
          escalate solutions now enables me to similarly do the same with other
          scenarios where the solutions can be narrowed down to the facts.
          However,
          <strong
            >giving it a go and writing down what I needed to do using
            mind-maps</strong
          >
          gave me visual-aid to see the step-by-step process of what needed to
          be done in order to get a close-ended conclusion. Therefore, this
          experience will hopefully allow me to strengthen my drive for data and
          be equipped to design thinking.
